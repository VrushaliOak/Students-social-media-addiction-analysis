# Students-social-media-addiction-analysis
Exploratory data analysis and visualization of student social media usage patterns using Python, Pandas, and Plotly

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes social media usage patterns among students to identify behavioral trends and factors contributing to addiction levels. Using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques, the project transforms raw survey data into meaningful insights that can support educational institutions and policymakers in understanding student digital behavior.

---

##  Problem Statement
Excessive social media usage among students can impact academic performance, mental well-being, and daily routines. The goal of this project is to explore usage patterns, identify key influencing factors, and visualize trends that highlight potential risk indicators of social media addiction.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

##  Dataset
The dataset contains student survey records related to:
- Social media usage frequency
- Time spent on platforms
- Behavioral and lifestyle indicators
- Academic and daily activity patterns

Each record represents an individual student with multiple attributes describing their interaction with social media.

##  Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Imported CSV dataset into Pandas DataFrame  
   - Checked for missing values and inconsistencies  
   - Performed data type validation and column formatting  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generated statistical summaries  
   - Analyzed distribution of usage patterns  
   - Studied relationships between behavioral factors and social media addiction levels  

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Created bar charts, box plots, and distribution plots  
   - Used interactive visualizations for deeper pattern exploration  
   - Compared addiction levels across different student groups  

4. **Insights & Interpretation**  
   - Identified key trends influencing high social media usage  
   - Highlighted behavioral indicators associated with increased addiction risk

##  Key Features
- End-to-end data analysis pipeline
- Clean and modular notebook structure
- Insight-driven visualizations
- Real-world behavioral dataset
- Recruiter-friendly documentation

## Results Summary

The analysis reveals clear patterns between time spent on social media and behavioral indicators such as sleep habits, academic engagement, and daily routines. Visual trends suggest that higher usage levels are often associated with reduced academic focus and changes in lifestyle patterns.
